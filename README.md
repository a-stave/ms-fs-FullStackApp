PROJECT REFLECTION

Copilot helped a lot in the debugging process. While getting the initial code set up was trivial, CORS was a bit of a curveball--especially when Copilot suggested only allowing the one client localhost's address, which became a bit of a game of whack-a-mole trying to track down which url to whitelist. Turns out 'AllowAnyOrigin' is a fantastic policy in development! But it was instructive, and I'm actually really curious whether CORS can be configured as a sort of firewall against suspicious or malicious origins? That'll be something to look into!

A more successful example was Copilot's helping me identify some basic stuff -- I'd implemented a client-side caching service to help improve performance, only to find it wasn't being called during page refreshes. Copilot helped me move to session storage since my original cache wouldn't survive a page refresh in WebAssembly; after a bit more frustration it pointed out my page was calling the backend rather than the service, bypassing it entirely. That was embarrassing...

Copilot's also proven decent at pointing out ways to expand the project. For simplicity's sake I copied my models into both projects, but it suggested migrating both into a shared .NET library. The advantages are obvious (and as a neophyte it's good to learn what another of those .NET templates is for!) but that'll be something for future projects to test out.
